# Kaiburr_Task3
This project builds a web UI using React 19, TypeScript, and Ant Design to manage numeric records and run commands. Users can create, search, and delete records, run checks to see if numbers are products of two integers greater than one, and view results in an accessible drawer with history, export, and localStorage support.
